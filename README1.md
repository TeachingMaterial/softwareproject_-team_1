# Phase 1 - Requirements Engineering

## **1. Introduction**
---
This markdown sheet describes phase 1 in creating student management system software for an online university. A student management system means that students can participate in educational activities such as attending classes, learning modules and tutorials, monitoring their progress and receiving feedback/results. Due to student management's facilities they are widely used in every educational institution such as schools and universities. The advantages of having a student management system software are students can access studies at any time from anywhere, reduce the workloads of institutions rather than maintaining physical storage and maintenance and improve productivity for lecturers by focusing on only teaching rather than maintaining and securing physical components. Therefore, this student management system is useful for every partipants in the educational institutions such as students, lecturers, insititution's director and more.

## **2. Software process model**
---
This is going to be an abstract of our software process to create student management system for the online university. This student management system final version going to produce on 23rd March will fulfill the requirements asked by our clients.

To produce this student management system, our organization is going to use incremental software process model. It is a method of software development where an initial student management system will be designed, will be implemented and tested little by little and produce final student management system fulfilling most of the stakeholder’s requirements.

The reasons are to choose incremental model rather than others are many. In below, some of them have provided.

1.	We are developing a software. There is a chance users/ stakeholders can come and request to change requirements. For examples, online university management can change in future. Therefore, some principles/ requirements can change.
2.	This is the first student management system for the online university is going to use. Therefore, our customers/ stakeholders can’t be sure what they want.
3.	There are some other model such as Waterfall model, it’s hard to go back and change the requirements when needed. It takes more time and money.
4.	Or, if integration and configuration model used, it can be too complex. Asking helps of some various software and components. They can lead to complexity and can’t be able to satisfy other stakeholders all the time. 
5.	In incremental model, it’s easy comparatively with other models. Easily can go back and change. Less time and money. Can satisfy each stakeholders’ needs.
6.	Easier to get customers’/ stakeholders’ feedbacks/ opinions while developing the student management system.
7.	Customer needs this student management system in quick. Therefore, the incremental model can fulfill the requirements in short period by its less numbers of activities in the model.

Figure 1 shows the workflow structure of our chosen software process model. The circle on the left in figure 1 describes the requirement gathered from our interviews with online university stakeholders. The middle rectangle has 3 software process activities. They are specification, development and validation. Each of them is concurrent activity. In the deeper description of each is,

1.	Specification: Making a formal document from the gathered user and system, functional and non-functional requirements. From that, we software Engineers will develop an initial version of student management system. It will be displayed to the system stakeholders of online university. This can be said as our phase 1.

2.	Development: From the initial version, system stakeholders will request some changes/ developments. They will be reconsidered back. Then, it outputs the intermediate version. It will be displayed to more other stakeholders and to some end users. This can be said our phase 
3.	Validation: Finally with every consideration of intermediate system, the system will be rechecked for last time to see whether it fulfills the customer requirements. Then, the final version of student management system will be implemented in the online university. This can be said our phase 3.

In the above, incremental software model definition, the advantages of the incremental software process model and workflow structures are described. But there is one more responsibility to mention. It is the limitation of the incremental software model. They are frequent incoming new requirements can corrupt the software structure and the development process is not visible. The outcomes of these would lead to more complex and spending and the developed versions’ costs can’t be estimated due to the rapid development. To reduce the effects of our limitations, we software engineers try to get our system and user requirements in completeness and consistent and reduce the imprecision of requirements.
