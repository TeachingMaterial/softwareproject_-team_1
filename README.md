## **6. Risk management and Identification**
---
### 6.1  **introduction**
For every software developmenet project, There are many risks that could implement the software's quality and the timeframe in which the software would be ready. There are too many risks which can inpact the software, and they are divided into 3 categories:  
* Bussiness Risks
* Project Risks 
* Product Risk

We have hghlighted some of the risks that are most likely to happen and we have arranged them according to the type of risk.   
   
The 2 tables below will dive into each type of risks and investigate ways we have decided to identify these risks, analyse them, plan for ways to avoid these risks to happen, and monitor the progress. For these tables the **threat** level is divided into **3** severities which are **low, moderate, and high** with the **Probability** level divided into **low, medium and high**. These 2 were then studied to extract a risk level which is divided into **3** colors with increasing level of risk with each color: <br/>
* **Green**
* **Amber**
* **Red**

 These probabilities were extracted after hours of research into competitors and studying relevant aspects of our team.

### 6.3. **Business Risks**

The table above identifies the business risks that are most likely to happen throughout the project development, with the most probable being technology changes and teammate inexperience. However teammate inexperience is the only high probability risk that has a high severity level as after conducting a servery between ourselves we found out that we are lacking in c# skills, so we have decided to allocate some of our free time into developing these skills as well as any inadequacy that would come to light at a later date. Poor staff cohesion as well as low stakeholder engagement have also been identified as high severity threats but we believe that they do not have a high probability of occurring, though it is imperative that we constantly monitor them, especially low stakeholder engagement as we found that it might cause alarming problems as software developement goes on. Thus the only 2 alarming risks are teammate inexperience and low stakeholder engagement. <br/>

### 6.4. **Product and Project Risk**

![](Product%20and%20Project%20Risk.png)<br/>

The table above shows the highlighted project and product risks that are the most likely to affect our project. The risks that are most likely to happen are frequent requirement changes requested by client, low estimation of time needed to finish certain tasks as well as hardware unavailability, with the only high probability risk of severe threat being the former, since due to the fact of staff inexperience it might be hard to implement big changes, thatâ€™s why we have decided to implement an incremental software development process model to make it easier to make changes in code structure and features. Hardware unavailability is another high threat risk as without the hardware, which is mainly the laboratory desktops that we are using, nothing can be achieved. That is why it is recommended that all team members download relevant software on their personal laptops so they can work from it. Both combined metrics combined to show that the most threatening of project and product risks are all identified risks with a high probability of occuring so it is advised to constantly check these risks using the moniitoring methods mentioned on the table.<br/><br/>
