## **2. Implementation**

The Student Management System system consists of several pages including a login page, OTP page, home page, course page, attendance page, timetable page, fees page, and student profile page. The implementation of each of these pages is discussed below: 


 **Course Page** -  The course page takes the user to their corresponding course page. We created course page's for four different courses.

It contains following elements/options:

- **Course Details** - Course information including Course name and Course leader name.

- **Announcements** - Option to add announcements regarding course.

- **Course Handbook** - Users can view the course handbook.

## **3. Testing**

To ensure the system works as intended, several tests were conducted during and after the development process. 

The testing involved the following steps:

- **Unit Testing** - We performed unit testing on each sections to ensure that they are working as expected. 

- **Integration & System Testing** - We performed integration testing on the entire system after merging to ensure that all the systems are working together seamlessly. 

- **Regression Testing** - The system was tested after any changes or updates were made to ensure that the existing functionality was not affected.


The testing process helped to identify and fix any bugs or errors in the system, ensuring that it works smoothly and meets the requirements of the users.
